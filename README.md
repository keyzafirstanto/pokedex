# Tentang Anak Pokedex API

Tentang Anak Pokedex is a backend API service that deals with CRUD in handling Pokemon monsters. Using primarily Node.js, Express.js, as well as TypeScript as its backbone language and mongoDB as its database. Moreover, the API is also using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to help establish connection with the database and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) to handle query or body validation. The program will be running on port 9000 however you are able to modify in `app.ts` or add it on your `.env`. I have also intentionally attached `.env` in this repo to make it easier to run.

## MongoDB as database - Reason to use:
In 2018, estimated 700 pokemons were counted and in 20219 estimated around 800-900 pokemons available for mass public to catch. Hence, if we looked at the increment of total pokemons per each year, i believe mongoDB will suit well with with the surge of number. This is primarily because non-SQL database is well-known for scalability and flexibility in terms of shape or size. Moreover, if we consider the evolving nature of pokemons, editing and updating pokemons would be one of primary concerns that we need to account for. Thus, non-SQL database can offer significant advantages by allowing flexible storage of diverse Pokémon attributes without rigid structures. Semi-structured, and polymorphic data efficiently, perfect for the varied nature of Pokémon attributes -- for instance, height, speed, and types. Additionally, NoSQL's distributed architecture ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and better performance, offering an optimal solution for dynamic Pokémon databases.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
## Notes
In case any failure in connecting with the database, please create new database from [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and copy your connection string into `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` file


## Seeding data

For the sake of smooth running program. I have created 2 seeding data that will be needed before you are able to run the program, which are `seed_monster.ts` & `seed_user.ts`.

I order to do seed the data, please follow below instruction:

```javascript
//in terminal console, make sure you are directed at pokedex directory and run: 
npx prisma db seed
```

open `package.json`, then you should find:

```javascript
//"version": "1.0.0"
"prisma": {
    "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed_monster.ts"
  },
```

Now i need you to replace `"seed": "ts-node prisma/seed_user.ts"` to `"seed": "ts-node prisma/seed_monster.ts"`

then rerun:
```javascript
//in terminal console, make sure you are directed at pokedex directory and run: 
npx prisma db seed
```

## Postman
Please download and import this [Postman](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xscdGyrnyK4_Ns6U2OWXFsLYAw2dVqxh/view?usp=sharing) collection to run and test the API.
